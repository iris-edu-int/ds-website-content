h1. Nominal Response Library

In 2006, the IRIS DMC began to collect an "authoritative" set of manufacturers' recommended nominal instrument responses in SEED RESP format and publish these on the web. The goal behind the Library is to make it easier for the seismological community to both share and create metadata for common instrumentation, and to improve response accuracy for users of the data.
