h2. Introduction

IRIS Data Services (DS) has very specific "charges":/ds/charges/ and consists of several components or "nodes". These nodes work together to insure the smooth flow of GSN and PASSCAL data from the stations to the seismological research community.

h2. Data Services Nodes

* "Data Management Center (DMC)":/ds/nodes/dmc/
* "IRIS/USGS Data Collection Center (ASL)":https://earthquake.usgs.gov/contactus/albuquerque/
* "IRIS/IDA Data Collection Center (IDA)":http://ida.ucsd.edu/
* "PASSCAL Instrument Center (PIC)":http://www.passcal.nmt.edu/
* "University of Washington (UW)":http://www.geophys.washington.edu/
* "Array Network Facility (ANF)":http://anf.ucsd.edu/
* "Kazakhstan Seismic Data Center (KZ)":http://www.kndc.kz/index.php?lang=en

h3. Components

IRIS DS is composed of seven distinct nodes. The Albuquerque Seismic Laboratory (ASL) and the UCSD/IDA DCCs collect data from the "GSN":/gmap/IU, perform QA on the data, convert the data to SEED and send the GSN data to the DMC. The PASSCAL instrument Center (PIC) performs QA and reformatting for PASSCAL data. The Array Network Facility (ANF) is charged with insuring that USArray/Transportable Array data flow to the DMC and that proper metadata is available. The Kazakh National Data Center in Almaty performs QA on data from the numerous arrays and stations in Kazakhstan before forwarding the data to the IRIS DMC. The UW, as the host of the IRIS DMC, produces data products as well as provides feedback on MUSTANG Quality Assurance System with an emphasis on how MUSTANG can be used with data from regional networks. The DMC in Seattle is the home of the IRIS data archive and serves as the primary distribution point for IRIS data.

h2. Governance &amp; Staffing 

IRIS DS is given oversight by a "standing committee":http://www.iris.edu/hq/about_iris/governance/ds (SC) representing the seismological community. (See "Action Items":http://www.iris.edu/hq/about_iris/governance/ds/#reports from DSSC meetings.) The IRIS Data Services is managed by Dr. Jerry Carter. Read about the charges to "DS":http://www.iris.edu/hq/about_iris/governance/ds.
