_Metadata_ is *data about data content* and is critical for analysis of timeseries data such as seismic data. IRIS has various web-based tools that allow users to query, view, and download metadata.

* "Dataless SEED":/data/dataless.htm : A dataless SEED volume contains the metadata for a request only.
* "Meta Data Aggregator (MDA)":/mda : View metadata summaries from the IRIS DMC database.
* "SeismiQuery":/SeismiQuery/ : Pre-formatted database queries that allow users to access data and information stored in the DMC Oracle database.
* "Virtual Networks":/vnets : A virtual network is a group of stations and/or seismic networks, representing an affiliation that goes beyond the traditional bounds of seismic networks to represent an umbrella organization or initiative.
