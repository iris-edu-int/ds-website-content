h1. QUACK is no longer in service

As of the start of 2016, QUACK has been removed from service.

The new MUSTANG QA system is now running on all seismic networks entering the DMC and QA metrics should now be accessed through MUSTANG web services. 

We hope users of QUACK will experience a comfortable transition to using MUSTANG to gather quality control statistics, PDF plots, and other information as relates to IRIS data holdings.  You can access MUSTANG using a web browser, command line tools, the @IRISMustangMetrics@ R package on CRAN, and clients like the MUSTANG Databrowser and LASSO.

Please explore the following URLs for more information on how to get started:

MUSTANG web service providing statistical data:  "$":http://service.iris.edu/mustang/measurements/1
MUSTANG databrowser web tool:  "$":/mustang/databrowser
LASSO station quality tool:  "$":http://lasso.iris.edu
CRAN repository for the IRIS metrics API written in R: "$":https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/IRISMustangMetrics

The helicorder plots are still available at "$":/servlet/webicorder/.
