The software that you have tried to access is no longer supported by the IRIS DMC.

h2. What can I do now?

There are several options to try:

# Check that the software has moved to the new DMC "Software pages":/ds/nodes/dmc/software/downloads/
# Check that the software has moved to a IRIS "SeisCode":https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/ project.
# Check if the software is still available under:
** "*http://ds.iris.edu/pub/programs/*":/pub/programs/
** "*http://ds.iris.edu/pub/*":/pub/
# "Contact the DMC":/ds/nodes/dmc/forms/contact/.
