h1. SeismiQuery is disabled

SeismiQuery has been disabled while we investigate security concerns with SeismiQuery interfaces.

Update July 18, 2022: The security concerns have proven to be valid, potentially severe, and difficult to mitigate. We do not have an estimate at this time as to when Seismiquery can be restored, either in full or in part.
