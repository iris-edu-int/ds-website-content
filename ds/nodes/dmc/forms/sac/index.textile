h1. SAC Software Request

p(alert alert-warning#requirements). *Please note*: The Seismic Analysis Code software is available to IRIS Members and Affiliates. As of October 2006, IRIS may also distribute the SAC software to collaborators such as the U.S. Geological Survey, Air Force Technical Applications Center, members of the International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks and other non-U.S. seismological institutes who are involved in relevant research projects with IRIS. However, IRIS may not distribute the SAC software to any country on the "embargoed list":https://ecfr.federalregister.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-C/part-746 of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
&nbsp;
Due to these export restrictions, SAC software requests must be reviewed by IRIS staff. This process may take a few days, and you may be contacted for details or clarification of the information you provide.
