h1. Data Product Suggestion

EarthScope welcomes suggestions for new data products. The EarthScope Data Services (DS) Product Development effort aims to produce data products beyond raw data that serve as the basis for research needs or end-use education and outreach material. DS products should not compete with the research community or duplicate current efforts by the community or other facilities or agencies. Proposals for products developed at the DMC will be reviewed and approved by the the "Data Service Standing Committee":https://www.iris.edu/hq/about_iris/governance/ds (DSSC) to ensure that the data products are useful to the research community.
