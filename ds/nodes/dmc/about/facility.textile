The Data Management Center is a state-of-the-art data center located in Seattle, Washington. We have over twenty full-time staff members dedicated to ensuring the highest quality seismic data is readily available to scientists around the globe.

The DMC data storage operates on a Hitachi Virtual Storage Platform with 1.2PB of usable disk. We discontinued the use of tape for near-line storage in 2009.

The DMC mostly works in a "VMware ESXi":https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html virtual machine environment. The advantages for this setup include:

* Lower power usage
* More effective crash recovery
* Ease of maintainence
* Greater ability to tune
* Greater ability to scale

We welcome visitors, and commonly host scientists for collaborative work from within the United States and from member institutions around the globe.
