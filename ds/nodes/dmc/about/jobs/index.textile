h3. Job posting guidelines

When submitting a job listing, please follow these guidelines:

* Put the job description in the *text of the message* -- do not include PDF or other email attachments.
* Put the *job title in the subject*.
* Include a *closing date* for the position.
* Send your message *exactly as it should appear* to users -- the text will not be edited, so if it starts with "Dear IRIS, please post this job" then that will appear in the final message.
