h2. Guidelines for using web services

"Web services":http://service.iris.edu hosted at the IRIS DMC ("http://service.iris.edu":http://service.iris.edu) should be used with following limitations:
* Users should limit usage to no more than *5 concurrent connections* to any combination of web services.
* Users should limit their clients to no more than *10 connections per second* regardless of the return capability of the service interfaces.

The DMC's network equipment will deny connections (via a TCP RESET) when the limits have been exceeded.

NOTE: In particular, polling for real-time continuous time series data is not allowed. For continuous, near real-time data please use our "streaming service":/ds/nodes/dmc/services/seedlink/.
