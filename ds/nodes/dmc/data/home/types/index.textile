h1. Data Types

; "Time Series data":/ds/nodes/dmc/data/types/time-series-data/
: Continuous seismic instrument recordings from thousands of stations worldwide.  This is the primary IRIS archive.
; "Metadata":/ds/nodes/dmc/data/types/metadata/
: Includes information such as recording instrument characteristics and data quality; this is generally used to determine the time series data to request.
; "Event data":/ds/nodes/dmc/data/types/events/
: Catalog of 4 million+ events, this is useful in determining the timeframe for retrieving useful data.
; "Assembled data":/ds/nodes/dmc/data/types/time-series-data/#assembled
: Discrete collections of waveform data, generally recorded over a period of weeks or months.  Assembled data are often "active source":/ds/nodes/dmc/data/types/time-series-data/, meaning that they include artificial seismic events such as explosive blasts intended to seismically map a given region.
; "Data products":/ds/products/
: Calculated datasets providing a higher-level view of the raw data.  For example, the "GMV":/ds/products/usarraygmv/ product is an animated map showing ground movement across hundreds of stations during an earthquake.
; "Historical data":/seismo/
: Scanned seismograms and other information from pre-digital sources.
