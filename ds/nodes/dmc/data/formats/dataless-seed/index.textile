h1. Dataless SEED

h2. What is a dataless SEED volume?

A _dataless SEED_ volume contains the metadata for a request only, including instrument responses, instrument coordinates, compression type, etc.. This dataless volume can be used in combination with a "miniSEED":/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/miniseed volume (as extracted from the BUD filesystem) with @rdseed@. A dataless, by definition, contains no "data", in the sense that no waveform data are included, only headers.

h2. Getting a Dataless SEED File:

# Generate a request for a dataless using the "online form":/ds/nodes/dmc/forms/breqfast-request/
# Submit a BREQ_FAST style request to dataless@iris.washington.edu
# Get a dataless from the "BUD Query Interface":/bud_stuff/bud/bud_start.pl?BUDDIR=/budnas/virtualnets/ALL
# Download "network dataless SEED files":https://ds.iris.edu/pub/RESPONSES/DATALESS_SEEDS/
