h2. Band Code

The first letter specifies the general sampling rate and the response band of the instrument. (The @A@ code is reserved for administrative functions such as miscellaneous state of health.)

table(table table-bordered table-striped).
|_. Band code|_. Band type|_. Sample rate (Hz)|_. Corner period (sec)|
|@F@| ... |≥ 1000 to < 5000|≥ 10 sec|
|@G@| ... |≥ 1000 to < 5000|< 10 sec|
|@D@| ... |≥ 250 to < 1000|< 10 sec|

1. These are approximate values. The sample rate should be used for the correct Band Code.

h2. Instrument Code and Orientation Code

The second letter specifies the family to which the sensor belongs. In essence, this identifies what is being measured. Each of these instrument types are detailed in this section.

The third letter in the channel name is the _Orientation Code_, which provides a way to indicate the directionality of the sensor measurement. This code is sometimes used for a purpose other than direction, which is instrument-specific. When orthogonal directions are used, there are traditional orientations of North (@N@), East (@E@), and Vertical (@Z@), as well as other orientations that can readily be converted to traditional ones. These options are detailed with each instrument type. Use @N@ or @E@ for the orientation when it is within 5 degrees of north or east. Use @1@ or @2@ when orientations are more than 5 degrees from north or east. Put the actual orientation of the sensor in the dip and azimuth fields of blockette @52@. 

h2. Seismometer

Measures displacement/velocity/acceleration along a line defined by the dip and azimuth.

h2. Tilt Meter

Measures tilt from the horizontal plane. Azimuth is typically N/S or E/W.

h2. Creep Meter

Measures the absolute movement between two sides of a fault by means of fixing a metal beam on one side of the fault and measuring its position on the other side. This is also done with light beams.

The orientation and therefore the dip and azimuth would be perpendicular to the measuring beam (light or metal), which would be along the average travel vector for the fault. Positive/Negative travel would be  arbitrary, but would be noted in the dip/azimuth. Another type of Creep Meter involves using a wire that is  stretched across the fault. Changes in wire length are triangulated to form movement vector.

h2. Calibration Input

Usually only used for seismometers or other magnetic coil instruments. This signal monitors the input signal to the coil to be used in response evaluation. Usually tied to a specific instrument. Sometimes all instruments are calibrated together, sometimes horizontals are done separately from verticals.

h2. Pressure

h2. Magnetometer

Measures the magnetic field where the instrument is sitting. They measure the part of the field vector that is aligned with the measurement coil. Many magnetometers are three axis. The instrument will typically be oriented to local magnetic north. The dip and azimuth should describe this in terms of the geographic north.

*Example:* Local magnetic north is 13 degrees east of north in Albuquerque. So if the magnetometer is pointed to magnetic north, the azimuth would be + 103 for the E channel. Some magnetometers do not record any vector quantity associated with the signal, but record the total intensity. So, these would not have any dip/azimuth.

h2. Linear Strain

One typical application is to build a very sensitive displacement measuring device, typically a long quartz rod. One end is affixed to a wall. On the free end, a pylon from the floor reaches up to the rod where something measures the position of the pylon on the rod (like a large LVDT).

There are also some interferometry projects that measure distance with lasers. Dip/Azimuth are the line of the movement being measured. Positive values are obtained when stress/distance increases, negative, when they decrease.

h2. Channel Code

We suggest that two sequences be reserved for special channels: the @LOG@ channel for the console log, and the @SOH@ channel for the main state of health channel. Subsidiary logs and state of health channels should begin with the @A@ code; the source and orientation fields can then be used in any way.

Here are some typical channel arrangements used by a GSN system:

table(table table-bordered table-striped).
|_. Channel|_. Description|
|@EHZ/EHN/EHE@|Short Period 100 sps|
|@BHZ/BHN/BHE@|Broad Band 20 sps|
|@LHZ/LHN/LHE@|Long Period 1 sps|
|@VHZ/VHN/VHE@|Very Long Period 0.1 sps|
|@BCI@|Broad Band Calibration Signal|
|@ECI@|Short Period Cal|
|@LOG@|Console Log|
|@ACE@|Administrative Clock Error|
|@LCQ@|1hz Clock Quality|
|@OCF@|Opaque Configuration File|

h2. Note

*Log Records:* Log records has a channel identifier code of @LOG@ and a sample rate of zero. The number of samples field is the number of characters in the record (including the carriage return and line feed that terminates each line). Log messages are packed into records until a message falls into a new minute. Log records have no blockettes, so the strings start at offset @48@. For examples of Log Records, @ACE@, and @OCF@ channels, refer to the end of Appendix E.
