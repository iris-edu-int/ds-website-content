h1. DMC vnets Retirement

The DMC's vnets service has been retired.  But not to worry, virtual networks are alive and well.

To browse virtual networks the DMC's Metadata Aggregator (MDA) is the best choice:
"http://ds.iris.edu/mda/#vnetlist":http://ds.iris.edu/mda/#vnetlist

For programmatic access to virtual networks, both virtual network definitions and resolved listings are available from the DMC's virtual network web service:
