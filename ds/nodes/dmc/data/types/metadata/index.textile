h1. Metadata

Metadata include station siting, instrumentation, and earthquake information which serve to enhance and support our waveform data archives.

h2. Tools

"Online tools for exploring metadata holdings":/ds/nodes/dmc/tools/#data_types=metadata

h2. Formats

h3(#dataless_seed). Dataless SEED

"Dataless SEED":/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/#dataless_seed is a subset of the SEED data format, and includes instrument responses, instrument coordinates, compression type, etc.. A dataless volume is commonly used to populate a metadata database or in combination with "MiniSEED":/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/#miniseed to convert time series to an alternate format such as "full SEED":/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/#seed (using the EarthScope DMC's "rdseed":/ds/nodes/dmc/software/downloads/rdseed/ software).

h3(#stationxml). StationXML

A modern alternative to dataless SEED volumes to exchange seismological metadata is the FDSN's "StationXML":http://www.fdsn.org/xml/station/ schema.

h3(#sacpz). SAC Poles and Zeros

A SAC Poles and Zeros file is used to provide instrument response metadata for timeseries data in SAC format.
