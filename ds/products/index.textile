Data products derived from raw data are produced both by the scientific community and the EarthScope DMC. These complement the simple data products based on raw data such as event segmented waveforms, which are available via the DMCs traditional "data access":/ds/data/ mechanisms. To ensure that the data products are useful to the research community, direct feedback and guidance is provided by the "Data Service Standing Committee":https://www.iris.edu/hq/about_iris/governance/ds (DSSC).
